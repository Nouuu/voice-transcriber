    ---

    **Red circle** - Currently recording

    Speak into microphone, click to stop

-   :material-circle:{ .lg style="color: purple" } **PROCESSING**

    ---

    **Purple circle** - Transcribing audio

    Wait for completion, result copied to clipboard

</div>

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üîÑ Reload Config
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚ùå Exit
```

### Menu Actions

**Start Recording**
: Begin audio capture (disabled while recording)
: Same as left-click when idle

**Stop Recording**
: End recording and transcribe (enabled only while recording)
: Same as left-click when recording

**Open Config**
: Opens configuration file in your default text editor
: Always available

**Reload Config**
: Reloads configuration without restarting the application
: Only available when idle (not recording or processing)

**Exit**
: Exit the application gracefully

!!! note "Menu Behavior"
    Menu items automatically enable/disable based on state:
    
    | Menu Item | Idle (üü¢) | Recording (üî¥) | Processing (üü£) |
    |-----------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
    | Start Recording | ‚úÖ Enabled | ‚ùå Disabled | ‚ùå Disabled |
    | Stop Recording | ‚ùå Disabled | ‚úÖ Enabled | ‚ùå Disabled |
    | Open Config | ‚úÖ Enabled | ‚úÖ Enabled | ‚úÖ Enabled |
    | Reload Config | ‚úÖ Enabled | ‚ùå Disabled | ‚ùå Disabled |
    | Exit | ‚úÖ Enabled | ‚úÖ Enabled | ‚úÖ Enabled |

## Configuration Management

You can now manage configuration directly from the system tray menu without restarting the application.

### Quick Configuration Workflow

1. **Open Config**: Right-click tray icon ‚Üí "Open Config"
2. **Edit**: Make your changes in the text editor
3. **Save**: Save the configuration file
4. **Reload**: Right-click tray icon ‚Üí "Reload Config" (when idle)

### When to Use Reload Config

**Reload Config** is useful when you want to:

- Switch between transcription backends (OpenAI ‚Üî Speaches)
- Test different language settings
- Update API keys
- Change transcription or formatting prompts
- Enable/disable the formatter

!!! success "Live Configuration Updates"
    Changes take effect immediately after reload - no need to restart the application!

!!! warning "Reload Restrictions"
    **Reload Config** is disabled during:
    
    - **Recording** (üî¥): Would interrupt audio capture
    - **Processing** (üü£): Would interfere with transcription
    
    Wait for the icon to turn green (idle) before reloading configuration.

### Configuration Reload Safety

The reload process includes automatic safety checks:

- **Validation**: Configuration is validated before applying
- **Rollback**: Previous configuration is restored if reload fails
- **Service reinitialization**: All services are properly restarted with new settings

If reload fails, you'll see an error message and the previous configuration will be restored automatically.

## Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed logging and performance metrics:

```bash
voice-transcriber --debug
```

### What Debug Mode Shows

Debug mode provides detailed information about:

- **File sizes**: WAV and MP3 file sizes with compression ratios
- **Audio format**: Sample rate, channels, conversion details
- **Processing times**: Breakdown of upload, processing, and response times
- **Transcription details**: Character count, duration metrics

### Example Debug Output

### When to Use Debug Mode

!!! tip "Debug Mode Use Cases"
    - **Troubleshooting**: Identify where delays occur in the transcription pipeline
    - **Performance analysis**: Understand audio compression effectiveness
    - **Quality verification**: Check audio format and processing details
    - **Benchmarking**: Compare different backends or configurations

### Disabling Debug Mode

Simply run without the `--debug` flag:

```bash
voice-transcriber
```
